<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The environment is our feedback. It's harsh and real and you can either do the movement or not... There is no cheating in parkour.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >I'm sure you've heard of pull-ups, maybe even muscle-ups, but climb-ups? These are an absolute essential movement within the parkour discipline. Once you've grabbed the top of a wall, maybe jumped to it, or wall-run... can you now pull over the edge and onto the top of the wall? Sounds easy, right? You've got your feet as well as your arms! How hard can it be? Well... Hard. Getting the technique correct and moving effectively can take years to master. Don't forget that to not use elbows or knees. Both arms and legs should be moving bi-laterally too.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Despite being tricky to master, climb-ups are very, very, useful. Almost every parkour video you may have seen will include the movement, but being unglamorous gets little attention.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >This is jumping and landing onto the side of a wall. Usually with a gap between the two. There are a few different variations, but the thinking is the same. The wall you're landing on will be either be too high or too far away to vault or jump onto. Therefore the cat-leap (followed by a climb-up) will get you to the side of the wall, rather than onto it.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The cat-leap is another highly filmed movement. It looks very impressive and can allow the practitioner to cover a great distance between the take-off and landing.

This type of movement is called traversing; which involves moving laterally along the wall using both hands and feet in unison.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Dismounting is one of those under-appreciated skills that require training in strength and control. The first issue is getting from a standing position on the wall to a hanging position (or cat position) on the side of the wall. In essence, if performed well, it resembles a reverse (or negative) climb-up.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Following the hang position is the actual drop. This requires you to push away from the wall with either foot or hand to create space beneath you. As you move backwards you will have the ability to look down at your ground target to drop onto. Timing is essential because you need to let go at the apex of the backwards push, so you have maximum distance away from the wall. One hand can remain in front of your head to stop any balance issues with the landing.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Perform larger drops by redirecting the downward force into a forwards trajectory.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Probably one of the most difficult fundamental movements to get right. Contrary to popular belief, the roll is not used to absorb the impact of a drop, nor is there a one-size-fits-all methodology of performing it. Rather, the roll is used to redirect the downwards momentum (that would normally load the leg muscles with all the force) into a forwards one; which can then be transitioned into some other movement.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The problem lies in the fact that you need to be able to perform on concrete, perfectly, every time. Otherwise, it's effectively useless because you'll either be loading the leg muscles too much, or the redirected force will hit a bone or joint and will cause damage.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >However, it's also the parkour practitioners super-power.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >'Breaking a jump' is a catch-all term for overcoming a challenge that scared you. You've essentially broken the fear in your mind. It doesn't need to be a jump, it can be any movement. As practitioners, the dopamine rush that you get from breaking a jump is what rewards us and keeps us moving onto the next one.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Fear training helps build mental toughness. Understand how to handle fear in a structured and incremental way through controlled risk.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Fear training is what sets parkour apart from most other sports, pursuits or disciplines. We understand that fear is something to understand, control and actively seek out to overcome. If you're not a little bit scared, then you're doing something comfortable, something you can already do... Which won't progress your ability.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Through managed risk, injecting an incremental (yet small) amount of fear into your training means you'll keep progressing and keep pushing forwards through mental boundaries.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Very rarely is the scary movements a physical problem. It's mostly a psychological one. If the same set-up was created with a soft, comfortable environment, you would no doubt be able to do it... Its the environment and situation that is causing the fear, not the physical ability level. Matching the physical level to psychological level (perform your max in any situation) is every parkour practitioners dream.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Overcoming fear is understanding the process from multiple angles. From experience, anatomically, chemically, bio-mechanically, logically, psychologically, emotionally and reactionary. How you deal with the situation normally, how to overcome the state you're in and move forward by building personal methods to battling it. Understanding exactly what your body is capable of doing and being comfortable with being uncomfortable. Realising which state your nervous system(s) are in and how to influence them.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Fear is something parkour practitioners actively seek out and train to constantly face.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Understanding what fear is and how to incrementally adapt yourself to it is like body-armour for the mind.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Also, parkour has been shown to give veterans a way to still experience fear which is usually cut away when entering back into civilian life. Fear training in parkour can keep that process of adaption and growth consistent and constant outside of military life.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Stealth Training is a very translatable skill to military work. Heightened control and practical movement tactics training for civilians.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >More of a specialism in parkour, and only trained by a small subset of practitioners, stealth training has roots in the training of the founders of parkour and original practitioners who felt that parkour was to move anywhere and everywhere, at any time. Stealth was then sometimes required in places that offered better training opportunities, but requiring more discretion; sometimes during what was more commonly called 'night-missions'.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The point of stealth training was to challenge the practitioner to have even <em>more</em> control over the body, with greater consequences, through better muscular control. Performing parkour without other people around them even knowing they were there meant that it increased the challenge by being requiring silence in their movements.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >This also meant that route-setting and planning the journey for avoidance also became a skill in itself. Seeing where to go, adapting to unforeseen situations and bypassing the usual paths of civilians has developed into something that can give the parkour practitioner many skills beyond that of normal training.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >During night-missions, there is the challenge of reduced vision and physical ability levels. However, a heightened understanding of using tactile feedback, proprioception, feeling, hearing and even smelling will translate into a much better practitioner who can appreciate the ease of the same environment on a lovely dry day.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The easy answer here is special-forces training, moving under the cover of darkness, moving while impaired and not relying on just vision.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Evasion is one of the immediate byproducts of good parkour. Being able to do much more, skill-wise, than regular civilians makes it much easier to evade.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Being fast, agile, controlled and versatile over terrain that others cannot go is the key to immediate evasion techniques. The practising of flowing movement through parkour, foot and hand placement technique and spacial awareness will help those adaption skills on varied environments and situations.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The physical challenge is the most obvious topic in parkour. Constantly asking the question &quot;what have I never done, but could try to do and accomplish&quot; is an easy way to look at it.

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - After Challenge, Adaptability is the second tenet of parkour. Move to the environment, shaping your skills to adapt to anything and everything.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" ><a class="underline hover:bg-goo hover:text-black"  href="https://vimeo.com/70072975">5D Raw Parkour 2 - Cinematic Edition. on Vimeo</a></p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >As parkour practitioners, we tend to think that we can handle many more situations and scenarios that are placed in front of us because that's the way we train daily. To make a more personal point, since 2005 I've never repeated the content of a class twice. Every single class has contained different themes, focuses, techniques, challenges and attributes. This means that students are always required to adapt to the class - whatever it may contain.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Secondly, the content of the class is never explained beforehand either. This is so there is no mental preparation for what's to come. Students must react and adapt to the immediate situation without prior knowledge. For example - if the coach told you before the class that you were going to do 1000 pushups, your mind and body will automatically start preparing for that. Knowing it will be tough means that you'll reserve strength on training before that horrible thing. However, just immediately having to perform the task in the state you're currently in makes you much better prepared to put 100% effort into everything and adapt to the situation.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Some things to note are:</p>
<ul class="text-xl list-outside list-disc bg-night mb-12 px-12 pt-12 pb-8 w-full" >
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >There are no rules - parkour challenges can be anything - it's what makes us versatile.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >The environment dictates the way - walls, railings and buildings won't change just because you can't do something. You either can do the move or adapt the route.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >Everything changes - The weather, the structures, your emotional state and nervous system, your strength, the surroundings, etc... Over time, everything changes, and should change. Adapting to that is key.</li>
<li class="pb-4 leading-relaxed" >Be ready for anything, at any time - When the time to <strong>need</strong> parkour comes around, you'll be ready. Run from that dog, chase the bus, climb the house because your keys are locked inside, help someone in need, push a car, lift a rock, move a fallen tree, etc... You're ready for that challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Just as it is in parkour, military service in war-zones is rarely predictable. You'll be required to think while moving, make decisions and tackle whatever you're up against. Rather than be worried about that next challenge, you'll know that you'll be putting in 100% regardless of what it is. You're always ready and willing to get the job done.</p>

<h2 class="text-6xl pt-24 border-t-4 border-goo mt-24 mb-12"  id="Parkour+Vision" name="Parkour+Vision">Parkour Vision</h2>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >TL;DR - Gain the ability to see the possibilities of routes, challenges, flowing of movement and training potential all around you using just the environment.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" ><a class="underline hover:bg-goo hover:text-black"  href="https://vimeo.com/69161824">5D Raw Parkour on Vimeo</a></p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >One of the first things that beginner parkour practitioners realise is that we see the possibilities of training all around us. From curbs, lamp-posts, railings, walls, benches, windows, cracks, bricks, signs and everything else around. We see the world differently because we'll constantly be thinking of the multitude of potential ways to move using that object in the form of a challenge.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >The other great side-effect is that we become much more aware of what is physically capable by the human body. It's almost always higher, further and more technically challenging than any normal civilian would think possible. This has been proven through secure facility testing (another service we provide at londonParkour) - Architects and security consultants do not understand real human abilities. Almost all, other than the most secure facilities, are woefully easy to infiltrate - purely because they do not understand how people like parkour practitioners see the world.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Firstly, the ability to get good training anywhere and everywhere means that you always have a gym around you. The creativity to build a good session that is challenging to you or your unit with nothing more than what's around you is a fantastic skill to have.</p>
<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >Secondly, being able to see (and even do) what humans are physically capable of doing at a high level will make you realise real security holes, potential infiltration/exfiltration points, unconventional movement routes and how to get to places other people cannot.</p>

<p class="text-2xl lg:w-4/5 mb-4 leading-relaxed" >BUT, we're the jack-of-all-trades: being pretty good at all of these topics at the same time. And when you combine them in various ways, it makes us a formidable force.</p>

Conditioning is the key here.</p>
