##  2. <a name='AboutTheProject'></a>About The Project

This was a hugely stripped down version of the website because it was initially using the X-Theme from [Theme.co](https://theme.co/x)
I was tired of the bloat that came with these types of themes and decided that being the supooseed web-developer that I am that I should actually do a little coding and create my own theme. I wanted to pull out everything that wasn't absolutely needed and code my own version of everything, as long as the overhead made sense.

This theme comes with a lot of plugins I wrote to enable me solve single problems with the minimum amount of code. No bloat or extra features that aren't required.

###  2.1. <a name='BuiltWith'></a>Built With

The theme DOES however require a couple of 3rd party plugins to run those are:

1. ACF. Advanced Custom Fields PRO. https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/

   This is the backbone of most of the custom functionality and admin options. Nothing will work without this.
   
1. Advanced Forms Pro. https://hookturn.io/downloads/advanced-forms-pro/ 

   A stellar plugin that sits alongside ACF. Create forms (This is for the contact form page) based on ACF fields.
   
1. Easy WP SMTP. https://wp-ecommerce.net

   To get SMTP working with Google Email.

1. Stripe Payments. https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/

   To enable the gift-cards on the website. May reeplace this in the future with a custom plugin.
   
1. TeamBooking. https://codecanyon.net/user/vonstroheim

   This is a fantastic plugin, well coded. This handles all of the class bookings and inteegration to google calendar.
   
1. WPBakery Page Builder https://wpbakery.com/

   This is the WYSIWYG Page Builder I use for rapid page creation. All custom plugins interface with this.
